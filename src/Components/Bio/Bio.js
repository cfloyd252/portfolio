                  Going from a small town boy with big aspirations to being able to call 
                  myself a father and web developer has been quite a journey. It all 
                  started with going to math camp (Well, it was more of a math and science 
                  honors program that high school students attended during their summer 
                  break). Thatâ€™s what sparked my interest in coding. My first 
                  experience with this new found passion by becoming the head programmer 
                  for my high school robotics team for the remaining 3 years of high school.
                  From there, I continued to take Computer Science college courses while 
                  raising and providing for two wonderful boys. Any free time I had was 
                  spent either going on runs or playing video games on my custom built 
                  computer. After spending years in customer service related jobs and now 
                  that my boys are becoming more independent, I finally found the time and 
                  opportunity to rekindle my passion for coding.
